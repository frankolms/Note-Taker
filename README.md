# Note Taker

This is a note taking app that saves a title for the note and text for the note to a database on a server. Upon opening the app and clicking Get Started, you will be taken to a page with all of your saved notes on the left side of the screen. You can click on the title of each saved note to display the title and the body of the note in the main window of the screen. When you type in a note title and text for the note, a save icon will appear in the top right corner of the screen. Clicking this will add the note to your saved notes on the left side of the screen.
